This script models the moisture uniformity across a crop of substrate/container grown plants. 
It demonstrates how water uniformity can drift quickly, and therefore how crop growth can drift. 
This creates a negative cycle that exacerbates with time. This model illustrates the important of regular overwatering to even out the crop.
